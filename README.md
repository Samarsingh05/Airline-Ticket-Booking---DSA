A console-based airline booking system implemented in C to manage flight reservations, cancellations, and ticketing with support for multiple routes and schedules. The system uses advanced data structures and simple graphical console output to provide an enhanced user experience and efficient seat management.

Each flight maintains its own seat map (10 rows Ã— 6 seats) and passenger waitlist.

Implements fast passenger lookup using a hash table indexed by passport numbers.

Handles seat allocation, booking cancellation, and automatic waitlist promotion.

Validates inputs such as date, email, and passport uniqueness.

Displays seat maps with colored and styled console output for better visual clarity.

Menu-driven interface with detailed prompts for route, schedule, and passenger details.
